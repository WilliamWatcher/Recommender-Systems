    "## Item-based Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rationale\n",
    "1. Relatively large number of users compared to relevant news articles. Thus it is easier computationally to compare items than users.\n",
    "2. Item stability > User stability. Once a news article is out, it's content is fixed, while a user might change taste often. This can make user-based collaborative filtering more inaccurate in relation to the user's present taste. Similarity between items is constanst, i.e. the need for recalculations will be less with item-based collaborative filtering.\n",
    "3. Few news article interactions per user. This makes it harder to guess similar users as in user-based collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Item-based collaborative filtering in a nutshell (MIND)\n",
    "\"Find articles that are likely to be of interest, based on shared user interest patterns. Return the top N articles that are most similar to any of the news articles the user has clicked on, based on the similarity calculations between items.\"\n",
    "1. For each news article a user has clicked, get an overview of articles other users have also clicked\n",
    "2. Matrix factorization for efficiency\n",
    "3. Calculate the cosine similarity of each article - i.e. the article most often interacted with together with the initial one\n",
    "4. Repeat steps for each news articles, and sort the recommendations list according to articles with the highest cosine similarity\n"
